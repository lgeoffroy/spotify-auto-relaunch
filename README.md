# spotify-auto-relaunch

Create an application for Spotify on https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/

Add a dummy redirect URI and create the .env file based on .env.dist

You're all set! Launch the app with `node index.js`.

### TODO:

- Wait for spotify to be ready instead of waiting a few seconds
- Better handle errors
- Completely rewrite using only dbus?...
